/*
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
 

Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

var rotate = function(nums, k) {
    let howManyToShift = k % nums.length // We can calculate how many we need to past at the start of the array by reminder of the k and the array length
    return nums.unshift(...nums.splice(nums.length - howManyToShift, howManyToShift))// We unshift the mutated array by splice
};
