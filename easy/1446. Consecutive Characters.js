/*
Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
Example 3:

Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
Example 4:

Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
Example 5:

Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
