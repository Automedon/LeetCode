/*
There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

 

Example 1:

Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. 
Example 2:

Input: keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"
Output: 73
 

Constraints:

keyboard.length == 26
keyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
1 <= word.length <= 104
word[i] is an English lowercase letter.
*/
var calculateTime = function(keyboard, word) {
    const hash = {};
    keyboard.split('').map((v,i)=>hash[v]=i);
    let ans = hash[word[0]];
    for (let i=1;i<word.length;i++){
      ans += Math.abs(hash[word[i]]-hash[word[i-1]])
    }
    return ans
};
