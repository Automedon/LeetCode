/*
Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.

 

Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
 

Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 2000
1 <= words.length <= 2000
1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10
queries[i][j], words[i][j] are English lowercase letters.
*/
function f(arr) {
  var cha = arr.sort()[0];
  return arr.reduce((acc, cur) => (cur == cha ? acc + 1 : acc), 0);
}

var numSmallerByFrequency = function (queries, words) {
  var arr1 = [...queries].map((x) => f([...x]));
  var arr2 = [...words].map((x) => f([...x]));
  return arr1.map((x) => arr2.filter((y) => y > x).length);
};
