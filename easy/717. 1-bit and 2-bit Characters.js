/*
We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

 

Example 1:

Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
Example 2:

Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
 

Constraints:

1 <= bits.length <= 1000
bits[i] is either 0 or 1.

var isOneBitCharacter = function(bits) {
  let i = 0;
  while (i < bits.length - 1) {
    if (bits[i] === 1) i++;
    i++;
  }
  return bits[i] === 0;
};
