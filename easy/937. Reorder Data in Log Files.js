You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

Example 1:

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
 

Constraints:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

    const d = logs.filter( a => !removeFirstIndex(a).match(/[a-zA-Z]/g));
    const l = logs.filter( a => removeFirstIndex(a).match(/[a-zA-Z]/g)).sort((a,b) => 
    removeFirstIndex(a) === removeFirstIndex(b) ? a.localeCompare(b):                     removeFirstIndex(a).localeCompare(removeFirstIndex(b)));
    return [...l, ...d]
};
