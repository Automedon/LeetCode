/*
Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
Output:

     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

var invertTree = function(root) {
    if (!root) return root;
    let newTree = new TreeNode(root.val)
    newTree.right = invertTree(root.left)
    newTree.left = invertTree(root.right)
    return newTree
};
